# Execution Log

## 2026-05-12 - LBC-001

Task:
LBC-001 - Define MVP Scope and Business Rules.

Actions:
- Confirmed the working directory was empty and not yet a Git repository.
- Initialized a Git repository for the project.
- Created documentation files for MVP scope, business rules, operational status, backlog, execution log, and session handoff.
- Kept LBC-002 in BACKLOG.
- Did not create application code.
- Did not install dependencies.
- Did not create Angular, Fastify, Prisma schema, migration, or seed files.
- Did not create `docs/architecture/stack-decision.md` because it is outside the authorized LBC-001 file list.
- Did not commit changes.

Evidence status:
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all` was run and listed the new documentation files as untracked.
- `git diff --stat` was run and returned no file stats because the created files remain untracked.
- `git diff --check` was run and returned no issues.
- `git add -N` was attempted only to make untracked files visible to `git diff`, but it was not completed because Git index access was blocked in the sandbox context.
- No commit was made.

## 2026-05-12 - LBC-001 Scope Correction

Task update:
The authorized LBC-001 scope was expanded to include `docs/architecture/stack-decision.md`.

Pre-change repository guard:
- `pwd` confirmed the current directory as `C:\Users\ricardodev\Desktop\Laundry-Booking`.
- `.git` was confirmed present.
- `git branch --show-current` returned `main`.
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all` showed only the LBC-001 documentation files as untracked.

Actions:
- Added the official stack decision document.
- Updated product scope with formal conflict logic, timezone policy, and official stack decision.
- Updated business rules with the formal overlap condition.
- Updated ops files to reflect the expanded authorized scope.
- Kept LBC-002 in BACKLOG.
- Did not create application code.
- Did not install dependencies.
- Did not create Angular, Fastify, Prisma schema, migration, or seed files.
- Did not configure Tailwind or deploy.
- Did not commit or push.
